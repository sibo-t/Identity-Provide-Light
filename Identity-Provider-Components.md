# Components:

1. User Directory / Identity Store
Stores user credentials and attributes.

Examples: Active Directory, LDAP, SQL databases, cloud-based directories (e.g., AWS Cognito, Azure AD).

2. Authentication Services
Verifies user credentials (password, biometrics, OTP, etc.).

Supports authentication protocols like:

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)

OAuth 2.0

OpenID Connect (OIDC)

3. Authorization Services
Determines what resources a user is allowed to access.

May include Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).

4. Token Service / Assertion Generator
Issues tokens (e.g., JWT, SAML assertions) after successful authentication.

Used for Single Sign-On (SSO) and API access.

5. User Management Interface
Admin portal or APIs for managing user accounts, roles, groups, and policies.

May include self-service options for users (e.g., password reset).

6. Federation Services
Allows trust relationships between different identity providers or domains.

Enables users to authenticate using external IdPs (e.g., Google, Facebook, or corporate SSO).

7. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Module
Adds an additional layer of security.

Supports SMS, authenticator apps, hardware tokens, etc.

8. Audit Logging and Monitoring
Tracks login attempts, failures, and administrative actions.

Important for security compliance and incident response.

9. Policy Engine
Applies rules and conditions for authentication and access (e.g., geolocation, device posture, risk score).

10. API / SDK Support
Provides integration tools for applications to connect with the IdP.

Often includes libraries for mobile, web, and backend systems.
